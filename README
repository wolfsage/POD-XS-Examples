POD-XS-Examples
=============================

A package (maybe one day) containing different XS samples
to get off the ground with.

Note that I'm still learning and these are my experiments,
but as I get them polished I'll make sure it's known which
are good examples and which aren't.

Currently:

  Simple-Class/                   - An example XS Perl class (package).
  Simple-Class-Private-Data/      - Store a char * in an object hidden from Perl using magic.
  Simple-Class-Private-Data-Any/  - Store any C pointer in an object hidden from perl using magic.
  Wrap-Op-Checker/                - Example usage of wrap_op_checker() to install custom op check routines
