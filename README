POD-XS-Examples
=============================

A package (maybe one day) containing different XS samples
to get off the ground with.

Note that I'm still learning and these are my experiments,
but as I get them polished I'll make sure it's known which
are good examples and which aren't.

Currently:

  Simple-Class/ - An example XS Perl class (package).
