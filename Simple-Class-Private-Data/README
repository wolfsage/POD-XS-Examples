Simple-Class-Private-Data version 0.01 (EXPERIMENTAL)
=============================

An example XS Perl class (package).

Interesting files:

  Data.xs                           - The meat of the class, in C/XS.
  lib/Simple/Class/Private/Data.pm  - The Perl side of the package.
  t/Simple-Class-Private-Data.t     - A test showing usage.

Created with:

  h2xs -A -n Simple::Class::Private::Data

And then cleaned up significantly.
