Wrap-Op-Checker version 0.01 (EXPERIMENTAL)
=============================

An example XS wrap_op_check implementation 

Interesting files:

  Wrap-Op-Checker.xs     - The meat of the class, in C/XS.
  lib/Wrap/Op/Checke.pm  - The Perl side of the package.
  t/Simple-Class.t       - A test showing usage.

Created with:

  h2xs -A -n Wrap::Op::Checker

And then cleaned up significantly.
