Simple-Class version 0.01 (EXPERIMENTAL)
=============================

An example XS Perl class (package).

Interesting files:

  Class.xs             - The meat of the class, in C/XS.
  lib/Simple/Class.pm  - The Perl side of the package.
  t/Simple-Class.t     - A test showing usage.

Created with:

  h2xs -A -n Simple::Class

And then cleaned up significantly.
