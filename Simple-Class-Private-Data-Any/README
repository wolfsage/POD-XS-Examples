Simple-Class-Private-Data-Any version 0.01 (EXPERIMENTAL)
=============================

An example XS Perl class (package) showing how to hide C data from Perl
(specifically a string in this example.)

Interesting files:

  Any.xs                                - The meat of the class, in C/XS.
  lib/Simple/Class/Private/Data/Any.pm  - The Perl side of the package.
  t/Simple-Class-Private-Data-Any.t     - A test showing usage.

Created with:

  h2xs -A -n Simple::Class::Private::Data::Any

And then cleaned up significantly.
